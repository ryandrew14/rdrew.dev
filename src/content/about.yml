      I study computer science at Northeastern University in Boston. I'm currently on a co-op
      at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, working remotely due to the current state of the US.
       At Northeastern, I founded and currently spend most of my time leading
      Sandbox, a software consulting student organization that builds software for academia.

      When I'm not working on school or Sandbox, I'm an avid open-source contributor, and I've written code
      for projects like Webpack and GatsbyJS. I'm interested in music, fiction, and engineering better 
      lives for humans.
