    I worked full-time as a software engineer, developing robust solutions to product requests
    in Python (Django) as well as JavaScript (React/Redux). I was also responsible
    for upgrading our QA processes; as part of this, I integrated Selenium
    into our CI service and wrote some starter tests, providing documentation
    and a company-wide tech talk to ensure longevity of the solution. Finally,
    I rewrote our frontend build with Webpack, increasing build performance by
    over 60% and decreasing bundle size.

    I worked as an intern on the solutions architecture team. I provided value
    to the sales and sales engineering teams by building a reusable demo environment
    for sales engineers to demo new features on. I also wrote product adapters
    to fit new customer use cases. To accomodate this, I attended both sales calls 
    and onsite sales meetings to better understand customer needs.
