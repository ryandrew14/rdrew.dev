      I study computer science at Northeastern University in Boston. I recently completed my first co-op
      at a start-up in Boston called Paperless Parts, where I enjoyed the luxury of being a large portion
      of the small product team. At Northeastern, I founded and currently spend most of my time leading
      Sandbox, a software consulting student organization that builds software for academia.

      When I'm not working on school or Sandbox, I'm an avid open-source contributor, and I've written code
      for projects like Webpack and GatsbyJS. Outside of programming, you can find me reading, training for my
      next long run, or debating with friends about Kanye's best album.

    I build useful and intuitive software that makes an impact on people's lives.
