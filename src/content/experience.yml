    I've done two internships with Facebook - one with Facebook AI Research and one
    working on the Creator Studio product. With FAIR, I built a block-based web programming
    interface (think MIT's Scratch) for programming a bot directly. The work was presented at
    ICRA 2021.

    I worked as a co-op on the Curiosity rover team, doing data visualization and
    contributing to flight software for the rover. I worked out of the lab facility
    in Pasadena, CA. I can't talk a lot about my work but it involved web development
    and firmware programming.

    I lead vision and growth for Sandbox, a new software consulting organization
    that I founded with two friends at Northeastern. We employ modern software deveopment
    practices to build impactful software for academic researchers. I've thoroughly enjoyed
    learning how to effectively scale an organization like Sandbox, which has gone from three members
    and one project to twenty-five members and six projects in just about a year. I also lead
    a team of Sandbox developers in construction of a web application for psychology research.

    I worked full-time as a software engineer, developing robust solutions to product requests
    in Python (Django) as well as JavaScript (React/Redux). I was also responsible
    for upgrading our QA processes; as part of this, I integrated Selenium
    into our CI service and wrote some starter tests, providing documentation
    and a company-wide tech talk to ensure longevity of the solution. Finally,
    I rewrote our frontend build with Webpack, increasing build performance by
    over 60% and decreasing bundle size.
